## Project 1: Connect
Connect is a web application to connect any service provider in the world with any one seeking for service, It provides 
very easy way for companies to propose their work and services to the users,also the users can be connected to any company
they want to get service from, we will guarantee the user's rights by forcing any service provider to upload his commercial record image and his identity card so that we can save the user rights in case that the service provider was a mock company or spammer


MVP : 

* We expect the user to find all proposed services from all registered companies only by entering `Explore` page.

* We expect the user to find companies and services online just by clicking on `Connect` button in the companies profile.

* we expect that any company can post about the service that it is providing, so that the user can see it.

* We expect that if a user want's a specific service he/she can create offer from the wanted company profile with the service the user want's

* We expect the user to see his activity on his profile page

* We expect that the user can provide his opinion by adding a review to a specific company after he takes any service from it.
